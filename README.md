# Professional Writing Repository
A repository for my course on professional and technical writing.

## Introduction

This is the first page in a repository we will use to learn some of GitHub's basic features. In class, we'll be going through the following steps:

- Exploring Markdown, one of the most typical writing formats used on GitHub.
- Learning how to fork a GitHub repository (a "repo") to a new branch, commit changes, and submit a pull request to the main branch for review.
- Creating our own repositories that others can push changes to.
